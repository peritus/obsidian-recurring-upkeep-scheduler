# Tire Pressure Check

## Optimal Pressure

- Front: 3.5 bar (50 PSI)
- Rear: 4.0 bar (58 PSI)
- Check when tires are cold (before riding)

## Tools Needed

- Floor pump with pressure gauge
- Valve cap tool (if needed)

## Inspection Steps

1. Check both tire pressures with gauge
2. Inspect for wear, cuts, or embedded objects
3. Look for uneven wear patterns
4. Check valve caps are secure

## Notes

Lower pressure in winter, higher in summer. Road tires need more frequent checking than hybrid tires.
