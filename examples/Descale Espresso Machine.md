# Descale Portafilter Espresso Machine

## Status

```recurring-upkeep-status
```

## Description

## Preparation

### Required Materials:

- **Amidosulfonic acid powder**: 40-50g (for 2% solution)
- **Water**: 2 liters (for descaler solution) + 6-8 liters (for rinsing)
- **Collection container**: At least 1 liter capacity
- **Blank screen** (for backflushing the brew group)

### Dosage:

- **Recommended concentration**: 2% (40g per 2 liters water)
- **Conservative**: 1.5% (30g per 2 liters water)
- **For heavy scaling**: Max. 2.5% (50g per 2 liters water)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never dose over 2.5% - risk of crystalline precipitations!

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Machine Preparation

1. **Heat up machine** until operating temperature is reached
2. **Empty water tank (if full)**
3. **Empty steam boiler**:
    - Operate hot water lever until no water comes out
4. **Empty brew boiler**:
    - Operate brew group control lever until no water exits
5. **Close all outlets**
6. **Turn off machine**

### 2. Prepare Descaler Solution

1. **Mix amidosulfonic acid solution**:
    - Dissolve 30g amidosulfonic acid powder in 2 liters lukewarm water
    - Stir well until completely dissolved
2. **Fill solution into water tank**

### 3. Perform Descaling

#### A) Descale brew circuit

1. **Turn on machine**
2. **Let heat up** until operating temperature is reached
3. **Place collection container** under brew group
4. **Operate brew group control lever** until descaler solution exits
5. **Fill heat exchanger**:
    - Keep lever activated until about 500ml have run through
    - Then pause

#### B) Descale hot water circuit

1. **Place collection container** under hot water wand
2. **Operate hot water lever** until descaler solution exits
3. **Run about 500ml through**
4. **Close lever**

### 4. Contact Time

1. **Turn off machine**
2. **Let descaler solution sit for 25-30 minutes**
3. **Meanwhile**: Remove remaining descaler solution from tank

### 5. Rinsing Process

#### First Rinse

1. **Fill water tank with fresh water** (2 liters)
2. **Turn on machine** and let heat up
3. **Rinse brew group**:
    - Without portafilter, run for about 60 seconds
4. **Rinse hot water circuit**:
    - Operate hot water lever until tank is empty
5. **Turn off machine**

#### Thorough Final Rinse

1. **Repeat step 1 at least 3-4 times**
2. **Total of 6-8 liters fresh water** through the machine
3. **Check after each rinse**:
    - No soap smell detectable
    - Water runs clear
    - No descaler taste

### 6. Completion

1. **Reinstall water filter** (if used)
2. **Fill tank with fresh water**
3. **Put machine into normal operation**
4. **Discard first espresso** (as safety measure)

## Safety Instructions

### ⚠️ Warnings:

- **Never dose over 2.5%** - risk of metal corrosion and precipitations
- **Do not heat descaler** - amidosulfonic acid is a cold descaler
- **Ventilate well** during descaling
- **Wear gloves** when handling the acid
- **Keep away from children and pets**

### ✅ Check for success:

- **Steam performance improved** (clearly noticeable after descaling)
- **Heat-up time reduced**
- **Noise reduced** (no more bubbling/crackling)
- **Even water flow**

## Frequency

### Recommended Descaling Intervals:

- **With filtered water**: Every 6-12 months
- **With tap water (soft)**: Every 3-6 months
- **With hard water**: Every 2-3 months
- **With bottled water (Volvic, etc.)**: Every 12-18 months

## Additional Tips

### From Practice:

- **Successful dosage**: 50g per 2L (2.5%) has proven effective with 25 min. contact time
- **Temperature**: Lukewarm to cold - hot is not necessary
- **Reuse**: Descaler solution can be used twice with light scaling
- **Steam wand**: Usually not necessary to descale, as steam doesn't transport lime

### For Problems:

- **Blocked hot water wand**: Remove before descaling and descale separately
- **Heavy scaling**: Perform descaling twice in succession
- **Unusual noises after descaling**: Rinse thoroughly again
